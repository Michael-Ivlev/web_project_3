              extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and

              springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the

              You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
              to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
              outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
              from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham,
              and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet
              dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by
              while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also

              your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on

              From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
              Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
              surprisingly common in this particular region of North America,
              over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher
              since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking
              this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and
              oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in
              Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling
              quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a

              before continue your bike ride!
