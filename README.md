**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Technologies and Techniques used**
* BEM
* flexbox
* grid
* adaptive layout
